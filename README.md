# DCGAN in gesture recognition
Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) used to produce the artificial signatures of gesture, based on gestures collected from AWR1642 automotive radar. The gesture samples
were collected from the Texas Instrument AWR1642 radar. This dataset was used in Radar-Based Recognition of Multiple Hand Gestures Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network ([MDPI publication](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/5/787),
[code repository](https://github.com/piotrgrobelny/AWR1642-hand-gesture-recognition)). The problem of machine learning in radar technologies is the lack of samples.
To overcome this, i'm working on the idea of artificialy created samples by DCGAN.
